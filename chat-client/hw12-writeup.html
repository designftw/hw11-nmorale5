  <h1>Writeup</h1>
  <p>
    This week I am turning in an implementation of the backend for my web app. It is an appropriate half way
    because I personally feel like working with Graffiti was the hardest part of the assignment, so having that fully
    done should make everything else easy moving forward. I spoke to Theia who agreed that this was a fair halfway
    point. I did not have time to do any CSS, but that will be what I spend the bulk of my remaining time on. Again,
    I just wanted to prioritize functionality for now.

    With my app, you can create your own private group chats and you can add people by typing in their username. You
    can also create and modify independent channels which makes things more organized for users.

    Next week I will add a bunch of CSS so that the UI actually looks nice and approachable. I also did not actually
    get to implement the super unique part of my chat app, which is the ability to create deadlines and have an
    integrated calendar to let you see all your upcoming work. No guarantees I get to make the calendar, but at minimum 
    I will implement the feature for setting deadlines and create a list (instead of the fancy grid calendar) of all the
    upcoming deadlines so that users can still use this functionality.
