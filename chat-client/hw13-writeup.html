  <h1>Writeup</h1>
  <p>
    I am turning in a design of a multi-layered channel app, intended for greater organization of messages.
    People can use this to create and invite people to groups, and then can create an endless number of
    channels within said group to divide up the messages and ultimately make things more organized.

    My app ended up straying away from the deadline idea due to time constraints, and instead functions very
    similarly to Discord.
